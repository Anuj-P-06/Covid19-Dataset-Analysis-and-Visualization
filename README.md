### Project Overview:
In this project, I explored COVID-19 data using SQL to analyze global infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress etc. I applied advanced SQL techniques like joins, CTEs, window functions, and data type conversions to calculate and visualize key metrics. This analysis helped me gain insights into the pandemic's impact across various countries and continents.

### Reasons for making this project:
1) Understand Global Impact: Analyze infection and death rates to analyse the pandemic's effect worldwide.
2) Vaccination Status: Assess vaccination progress of COVID-19.
3) Analyze Variations by Region: Examine how COVID-19 affects different regions and continents differently.
4) Enhance SQL Skills: Improve proficiency in handling complex queries and working with large datasets.
